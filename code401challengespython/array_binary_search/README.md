# Binary Search
Using binary search, find a value within a 1D array.

## Challenge
Create a function that takes in an array and a value and searches for the index of that value in the array. If the value is not in the array, return -1.

## Approach & Efficiency
We used a while loop to loop through an array to try and find the value. If the value was found, we would return the index.
