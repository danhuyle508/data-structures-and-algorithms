# Trees
Binary trees with add, contains, inorder,preorder,and post order fucntions.

Add a function called breatdh-first-traverse that traverses a tree using the bft approach

## Challenge
Create a class BinarySearchTree that adds adn searches values into a binary tree. Create a class called BinaryTree that returns an array with values inorder, postorder, and preorder.

Add a function called breatdh-first-traverse that traverses a tree using the bft approach

## Approach & Efficiency
Big O
time: O(N)
space: O(N)
