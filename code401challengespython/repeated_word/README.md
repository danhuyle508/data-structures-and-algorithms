# First repeated word
A function that checks for the first repeated word in a phrase.

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in a phrase and checks for the first word that is repeated.

## Approach & Efficiency
The first way I thought of was just splitting the phrase and putting it into an array if the word isn't in the array already. However, a hash table makes more sense because if instead of looping through the whole array, a hash table can find the value instantly.
