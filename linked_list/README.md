# Singly Linked List
This program takes in a value and added it into a linked list. This program also can print out the list if the user chooses.

## Challenge
Write a class called linked_list that allows the user to input a value and add it to the linked list and allow the suer to print the list.

## Approach & Efficiency
Using the tes driven development idea, I wrote the tests that it needs ot pass first, then wrote the code that would pass my test.

## API
No APIs.

# Linked List Insertions
This program can insert any value in th the linked list to the end of the list, before and after and node.

## Challenge
Write 3 functions where one appends a value to the end of the list, one inserts before a node, and one to insert after a node.

## Approach & Efficiency
Using the code from our last challenege, we added functions to complete all these tasks. 

## Solution

# kth from the end of a Linked List
This function finds the value k from the end of the linked list

## Challenge
Write a function that finds the value of k fro the end of the linked list.
