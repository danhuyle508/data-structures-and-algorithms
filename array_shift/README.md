# Insert and shift middle index of array
Insert a value into a list without using built in functions.

## Challenge
Create a function that takes in an array and a value and inserts the value into the middle of the array. No built in funcitons can be used.

## Approach & Efficiency
We created a new array and appnded the values of the old array into the new one. Once we hit the middle index, we appended the value and then appended the rest of the old array.
